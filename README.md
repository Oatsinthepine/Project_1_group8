# Project_1_group8
This repository is for the group 8's project 1, which is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project which contains the data cleansing, plotting, statistical testing and written analysis from the kaggle loan data. The whole project is completed using python programming only, within the jupyter notebook environment, libraries used including pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Project proposal: (Finance)
## How does the loan/debt impact population demographics based on personal parameters?

### Reason for choosing this topic: 
Growing number of people in mortgage stress amid rise in loan defaults, we want to gain insights about how people's lives are affected by loan/debt. In regards to their personal situation that contibute to different outcomes. We also want to know whether different personal parameters can result in different overall loan status. 

The data we used for this EDA project is searched from Kaggle website, called 'Loan-Dataset, About the status of the loan based on different parameters'.

steps for approaching this EDA project: download the raw csv file, create jupyter notebook and loading the csv as dataframe, accessing and examining the data, performing data cleansing, subseting and reframing, conduct series of statistical testing to understand the data, plotting and then finalising the written analysis about the question.

Main focus of the project from the chosen dataset:

- Is there any relationship between loan amount and people’s income? 

- Does home ownership affect the loan grades? 

- What is the median interest rate for the loan? 

- What are the correlations between different attributes? 

-What are people’s loans mainly for? 

- How does employment duration impact loan approval rate? 

- Is there any relationship between the term of years and loan status?

- How does income affect loan repayment? 

Through answering the questions above we want to gain deeper understanding about what will loan/debt being affected by which factors.

Besides the .ipynb, the project also contains a powerpoint slides for detailed presentation. A sample data from the dataset to look upon.
